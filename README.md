Description:

This project implements a reverse shell scripting attack, which is a type of remote access Trojan that allows an attacker to take control of a victim's computer. The attack works by establishing a connection between the attacker's computer and the victim's computer, and then using a reverse shell script to execute commands on the victim's computer.  The project consists of two files, one for the attacker and one for the victim. The attacker file contains the script that initiates the connection and executes the commands on the victim's computer, while the victim file contains the script that listens for incoming connections and allows the attacker to take control.  To use the reverse shell attack, the attacker simply needs to run the script on their computer and provide the victim's IP address and port number as arguments. The victim file should be run on the victim's computer, either by directly executing the script or by tricking the victim into running it through social engineering tactics.  It's important to note that reverse shell scripting attacks are illegal and can have severe consequences, including legal action and imprisonment. This project is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for any illegal activities.
